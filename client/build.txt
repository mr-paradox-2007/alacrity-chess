# Build script for the native Alacrity Chess client.
# This should be run from within the alacrity-chess/client directory.

# Compile the native Raylib client
# The -L and -l flags link against the Raylib library.
# The -I flag includes the Raylib header directory.
# Additional system libraries are typically required for Raylib on Linux.
# IMPORTANT: Library flags (-L, -l) must come AFTER the source file(s) and the -o flag.
