# Starting my development process

Yeah just starting my project pushing it to github.

# Thinking about what to develop first


Before that I'm just gonna figure out the basic file structure first tho.

Making the basic project structure.

Ok now lets really think about this, gonna make the logger then what ?

Probably gonna start with making the backend and the datastructures along the way rather than the other way around, and gonna write tests for them aswell, gonna make the server, the users, the requirements, really focus on how everything must work together and which ds to use where.

Gonna setup web assembly Raylib and other tools and start testing them then moving onto actually developing them and debugging them then and there.

# Developing the logger

Importing and chaning previous logger.

Testing new logger with stress test.

Tested with 2KB files sizes, and multiple process and much more.

Reverted memory changes.
